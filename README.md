# LangGraph Tutorial

This is a repo accompanying my youtube tutorial on using LangGraph to to create an assistant bot that can book and cancel appointments.

To run the code here you will need to install the packages listed in the requirements.txt:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the streamlit app, you can use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

If you otherwise stumble on this repo, you can find the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q9JY9n9f1A).

Happy Agent Building!
